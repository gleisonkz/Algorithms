# Scrapping YouTube Video info To Post on Another Page

## Automation created on Python using [Selenium][selenium] and [PySimpleGUI][py-simple-gui] to register my active and passive practice of listening skills on [Aprovado][aprovado].

## What exactly this script does is get the Title and Time Duration of a YouTube video and go to the website Aprovado, Log into my account and register the activity according to the video URL.

## It was so funny and so exciting for me to do this because, It was my first time using those libraries, and it was an interesting challenge for me.
