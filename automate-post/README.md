# Web Scrapping and Navigation With Selenium

## ðŸ“– About the project

Automation created on Python using [Selenium][selenium] and [PySimpleGUI][py-simple-gui] to register my active and passive practice of listening skills on [Aprovado][aprovado].

What exactly this script does is get the Title and Time Duration of a YouTube video and go to the website Aprovado, Log into my account and register the activity according to the video URL.

It was so funny and so exciting for me to do this because, It was my first time using those libraries, and it was an interesting challenge for me.
